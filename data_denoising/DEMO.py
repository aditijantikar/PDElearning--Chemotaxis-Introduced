'''
This function runs the surface fitting and partial derivative
approximation segment of the pipeline. Data are loaded into 
memory via the SurfNN class. By selecting options below, the 
user can either: (1) train a new artificial neural network (ann)
or (2) make predictions using the ANN, finite differences (fd),
univariate splines (sp), or bivariate splines (bsp). Predictions
are saved as dictionaries in the data folder. Each dictionary 
contains lists of input/output variables as well as their names.

In order to make animations or compute RMSE tables, see 
"make_animations.py" or "make_rmse_tables.py", respectively.
